# Python-Games

## Description
This is a directory of classic arcade game clones that I made for fun. I consider these to be 
fairly crude depictions of the original games, but I had a lot of fun creating them and learned
a lot along the way.

## Technologies
* Python version: 3.7.0
* Pygame library version: 2.0.1

## List of Games
* [Pong](https://github.com/jfawcet5/Python-Games/tree/main/Pong): A very simple implementation of the classic pong arcade game. This was the first game I made with pygame and I think it turned out alright.

* [Space Invader](https://github.com/jfawcet5/Python-Games/tree/main/SpaceInvader): My simple clone of the classic space invader arcade game. This was the second game I created with pygame and I drew all of the pixel art for the game using [this website](https://www.piskelapp.com/). There are a few features I never got around to adding (such as the red spaceship that occasionally flies by), but it is still a lot of fun.

* [Joust](https://github.com/jfawcet5/Python-Games/tree/main/Joust): My implementation of the classic arcade game Joust. This is the third (and currently incomplete) game I made with pygame and similar to space invader, I drew all of the pixel art with [this website](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to resemble the actual game as best I could. There are many features I still need to add to this game (such as the lava troll, better enemy AI, pterodactyls, etc.), but the current version is still playable and pretty fun.
